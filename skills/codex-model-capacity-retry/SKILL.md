# Codex model-capacity retry

Use this skill for a provider-capacity interruption, or the specific provider transport failure `stream disconnected before completion`, not for a normal task failure. The important invariant is to continue the existing task: do not create a new `codex exec` task, do not choose a replacement model, and do not set reasoning effort.

## Start an independent watcher

A skill loaded inside the failed turn cannot intercept the request that already failed. Start the watcher from an independent terminal process:

```bash
python3 /Users/derek/.agents/skills/codex-model-capacity-retry/scripts/scan_and_retry_sessions.py --watch --daemon \
  --exclude-session-id CONTROL_TASK_SESSION_ID
```

`--daemon` detaches the watcher from the terminal, shell, or Codex tool session that started it. This is required when the launching terminal may close; without it, the operating system may reap the watcher with that terminal. It waits five seconds after detecting a capacity error, then retries indefinitely. Stop it only when the user asks or when the original task has completed. There is no fixed attempt limit. The watcher remembers the exact failed completion, so it does not duplicate one failure; a later capacity failure appended to the same task has a new signature and is retried again.

The detached watcher writes its PID to `~/.codex/codex-capacity-retry.pid` and its output to `~/.codex/codex-capacity-retry.log`. The state-file lock prevents a second watcher from duplicating retries.

Before retrying a capacity-failed completion, the watcher sends `/goal resume` to the same task, then waits five seconds and sends the normal `continue` prompt. The state file records Goal restoration per failure signature, so a temporary failure on the second step does not repeatedly reactivate the same Goal. If the task has no Goal, `/goal resume` is harmless and the normal `continue` retry still runs. If the Goal was cleared, completed, or stopped by budget, the watcher cannot recreate it; the task needs a new Goal.

`CONTROL_TASK_SESSION_ID` is the session ID of the task that owns the watcher or heartbeat. Exclude that task so the watcher never attempts to resume its own controller task. Repeat `--exclude-session-id` when one watcher is coordinating more than one controller task. The same list can be supplied through `CODEX_RETRY_EXCLUDE_SESSION_IDS`, separated by commas.

## What it scans

It never resumes a `codex exec` session (`source: exec` / `originator: codex_exec`). That session belongs to the program that ran it, which is waiting on the process and owns its retry; resuming it from here races the owner for the thread's writer (`already has an active writer`) and runs a turn nobody reviews. Services such as ceo-agent-service run every turn this way.

The scanner groups rollout files by session and uses the newest turn boundary across the group. It retries only when that newest boundary is a capacity-failed completion or a completion whose direct error states `stream disconnected before completion`; an older retryable failure is ignored while a newer turn is running or has completed. Symptoms are evaluated only from the completion's direct terminal-error fields: `message`, `codex_error_info`, `error.message`, and `error.codex_error_info`. It never evaluates `last_agent_message`, which is normal answer text and can legitimately mention a status code or an amount such as `$429.06`. It must never retry an authentication, permission, validation, tool, or business-logic failure.

If the rollout metadata marks the record as a `source.subagent`, the scanner uses its existing `parent_thread_id` as the retry target. Multi-agent v2 subagent sessions cannot be resumed directly after they are unloaded; continuing the parent task preserves the original task and avoids repeatedly producing the `resume the parent first` error.

For a CLI-owned session it runs:

```text
codex exec resume --json --skip-git-repo-check SESSION_ID "continue"
```

The command keeps the original session ID, allows the detached watcher to run independently of the launching directory, and does not pass `--model`, `--thinking`, `model_reasoning_effort`, or an effort override.

## Active-writer recovery

The latest `task_complete` is necessary but not sufficient to send `continue`: a Desktop task can still have an active writer after that record has been written. The watcher first tries `codex exec resume` so the task can continue directly.

If either Goal resume or normal resume returns `thread-store conflict` or `already has an active writer`, the watcher queues the exact same prompt on the exact same thread with `codex queue --thread SESSION_ID --message PROMPT`. A successful Goal queue is recorded as the first stage; a successful `continue` queue records the failure signature, so the watcher does not enqueue duplicates every five seconds. If queueing fails, the signature remains retryable and the watcher tries again later. An incidental `401`/`token_revoked` warning does not override this active-writer result; a genuine authentication error with no writer conflict is suppressed as before.

When checking a Desktop task manually, inspect only the newest turn first. A task is eligible only when its newest error is a capacity error; never revive a task just because it is `failed` or `systemError`.

## Boundaries

- Preserve the original task/session/thread ID and the original model settings.
- Retry continuously at five-second intervals until the task produces a non-capacity completion or the watcher is stopped.
- Do not retry semantic evaluation failures, Buildkite test regressions, missing fixtures, provider authentication failures, ordinary tool errors, or generic stream errors other than `stream disconnected before completion`.
- Do not use a new `codex exec` invocation as a substitute for resume.
- The default scan age is six hours; set `CODEX_RETRY_MAX_AGE_SECONDS=0` to scan all session files.
- Use the state file to coordinate multiple watchers; a lock prevents duplicate watchers from retrying the same task.

## Verification

Run the bundled regression test:

```bash
bash /Users/derek/.agents/skills/codex-model-capacity-retry/tests/test_session_scanner.sh
```

The test proves capacity matching, same-session Goal resume followed by `continue`, no model/effort override, duplicate suppression, repeated retry after a new capacity failure, suppression of normal answer text that merely contains a `429` amount, historical rollout suppression, controller-session exclusion, and active-writer recovery by queueing exactly one same-thread Goal resume and one same-thread `continue`.

It also verifies that `--daemon --once` returns control to the launching process, preserves the launch working directory for `codex exec resume`, and exits cleanly.
